SBT Configuration:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.sangria-graphql" %% "sangria" % "1.4.1"
```

You can find an example application that uses akka-http with sangria here:

More info and the documentation can be found in the project home page:

[http://sangria-graphql.org](http://sangria-graphql.org)

I would also recommend you to check out [http://try.sangria-graphql.org](http://try.sangria-graphql.org).
It is an example of GraphQL server written with Play framework and Sangria. It also serves as a playground,
where you can interactively execute GraphQL queries and play with some examples.

If you want to use sangria with [react-relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay) framework, then you also may be interested in [sangria-relay](https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria-relay).

Sangria is a spec compliant GraphQL implementation, so it works out of the box with [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client), [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/), [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) and other GraphQL tools and libraries.
